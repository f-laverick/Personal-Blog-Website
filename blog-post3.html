		              America gained largely after the war, both socially and economically. An idealised way of living was created, 'The American Dream'.

		              The 1950s saw the 'invention' of the teenager. Before this, children would grow up to become their parents, but now they began to express themselves and found their own independence.

		              During the 1960s, the long held values and social norms of the time seemed to break down, especially with this newer, fresher, younger generation. Young men and women became political activists and were the driving force behind many anti war movements. Attitudes towards sexuality loosened and women began to protest against the traditional female roles.

		            <p>
		              As well as activism, the art culture was also affected. This included rock music, spirituality and pop art. Some of the influential figures in this field consisted of Wes Wilson, Victor Moscoso, Bonnie MacLean, Rick Griffin, Stanley Mouse and Alton Kelley.

		              It is clear that Wes Wilson was heavily inspired by the Art Nouveau style. One of his greatest influences was the Austrian painter and designer, Alfred Roller. The Roller typeface was named after Roller. Roller used this typeface in many of his posters that he designed Secession exhibitions.
